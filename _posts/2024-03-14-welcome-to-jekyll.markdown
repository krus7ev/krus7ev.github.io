# "Hello World!" from `jekyll`!
Apparently, I found this post in my `_posts` directory after installation. They say to go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see my changes - that I can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates my site when a file is updated (except for Jekyll's `_config.yml`).

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, one needs to include the necessary front matter. I must take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
