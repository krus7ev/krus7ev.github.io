const verses = [
`When loud cacophony's defaming,
Although you are of tender years,
And when you find their judgement's framing
Your loss of honour with their smears;`,

`Alone among the frigid rabble,
I take upon myself your pain
And for you with my fruitless gabble
To heedless idol beg again.`,

`But condemnation's harsh intrusions
The world will never cast aside:
It won't chastise the proud's delusions -
Instead their grasp contrives to hide.`,

`So all its two-faced persecution
And all the love it shows in vain
Deserve contempt, not absolution:
Prepare then, for oblivion's reign;`,

`And don't imbibe from poisoned chalice;
Abandon brilliant, stuffy sphere;
Abandon mad diversion's malice:
One friend alone you have - he's here.`,

`- "Когда твои младые лета" by Alexander Pushkin, 1829 -
   (translation by Rupert Moreton)
