This website intends to showcase my projects and personal experience in Computer Science and other areas. I might also modestly share some ideas and news about me on the [blog].

Please note, that all expressions of my opinion on any subject should be taken with a grain of salt and an open mind, as it tends to change with time. To gain a better idea of my core beliefs and motivation, see [Values]
