# Mind the `void`!

This website is a `public` `static` space on the _internets_, showcasing my projects and personal experience in Computer Science and other avenues of life. I might also modestly share some ideas and news on the [blog].

Please note, that all expressions of my opinion on any subject should be taken with a grain of salt and an open mind, as it tends to change with time. To gain a better idea of my core beliefs and motivation, please see [values]!

To all passengers on the platform: _Mind the gap, please mind the gap!_
