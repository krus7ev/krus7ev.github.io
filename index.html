<h1>Hello and welcome to <code>kidoai</code> !</h1>

It's my website as a grown up.<br><br>

I'm  <span data-tooltip="Christian, transcribed to Kristian in BG, friends call me Christianson">Chris</span> and a software engineer with <span data-tooltip="Bachelor of Science">BSc</span>  in <span data-tooltip="Computer Science">CS</span> from <span data-tooltip="University of Bristol">UoB</span> and five years of professional practice in <span data-tooltip="Natural Language Processing">NLP</span>, <span data-tooltip="Computer Vision">CV</span> and microservices architecture with <span data-tooltip="Continuous Integration & Deployment"">CI/CD</span>. Prior to that, after <span data-tooltip="British for University">UNI</span>, I received training in <span data-tooltip="Integrated C  ircuit">IC</span> design and verification and worked as a <span data-tooltip="Very Large-Scale Integration">VLSI</span> firmware engineer for a <span data-tooltip="A nibble corresponds to half of a byte and thus four bits">nibble</span> over a year.<br><br>

Currently I'm mainly interested in <span data-tooltip="Machine Learning">ML</span>, <span data-tooltip="Computer Graphics">CG</span> and compiling this portfolio. Apart from these, I like to research and develop useful little workflows, scripts and tools. I'm also quite passionate about art, film and photography. Of course, most of all I love to find time for my family and for reading a good book.<br><br>

And I walk the dog too.<br><br>
