<h1>Hello and welcome to <code>kidoai</code> !</h1>

It's my website as a grown up.<br><br>

I'm  <span data-tooltip="Christian, transcribed to Kristian in BG, friends call me Christianson">Chris</span> and a software engineer with <span data-tooltip="Bachelor of Science">BSc</span>  in <span data-tooltip="Computer Science">CS</span> from <span data-tooltip="University of Bristol">UoB</span> and five years of professional practice in <span data-tooltip="Natural Language Processing">NLP</span>, <span data-tooltip="Computer Vision">CV</span> and microservices architecture with <span data-tooltip="Continuous Integration & Deployment"">CI/CD</span>. Prior to that, after <span data-tooltip="British for University">UNI</span>, I received training in <span data-tooltip="Integrated C  ircuit">IC</span> design and verification and worked as a <span data-tooltip="Very Large-Scale Integration">VLSI</span> firmware engineer for a <span data-tooltip="A nibble corresponds to half of a byte and thus four bits">nibble</span> over a year.<br><br>

Currently I'm mainly interested in <span data-tooltip="Machine Learning">ML</span>, <span data-tooltip="Computer Graphics">CG</span> and compiling this portfolio. Apart from these, I like to research and develop useful little workflows, scripts and tools. I'm also quite passionate about art, film and photography. Ofcourse, most of all I love to find time for my family and for reading a good book.<br><br>

And I walk the dog too.<br><br>

<!-- I graduated Computer Science from University of Bristol receiving distinction for my BSc thesis, demonstrating that my supervisor’s novel and super efficient Mutual Information estimation formula works on neural spike train signals.

Next, back home, worked on VLSI routers design & verification and firmware development for a communications hardware giant for a while.

Then worked for five years together with a small team on engineering NLP and Vision applications for the business and media intelligence industries. Created key ML models, micro-services framework and software components bottom-up.

Also undertook a very complex document image analysis project for the last two years - initially with my long-term intern, then on my own as they went on to create and sell a startup after a crypto forecasting hackathon that we won (congrats guys!).

Lately I’ve been studying math and music and doing my own carpentry. I’ve got some great business and film ideas and cinematography know-how and can design excellent kitchens in blender.

My mind is really split in three between AI, CG and embedded stuff in terms of what I might do next.

Will mostly focus on family and books though, ultimately. -->
